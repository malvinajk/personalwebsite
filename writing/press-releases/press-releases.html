                <h3 class="subtitle">HAUNTED HOUSE</h3>

                <q>Ghost Show is co-curated by Kavitha Balasingham and Rory Beard. It will open on Monday 31st October and run till Saturday 5th November 2022. As artists from the Deptford and South London area, we know that the professional art community can at times be limited. Our primary aim is to break down the unseen barriers of contemporary art and to share the joy and creativity that we experience and benefit from every day. If we were able to inspire one person from the South London community, we would feel as though we had been successful in our project. The aim is to encourage people to engage with art, think more creatively about the world and be more accepting of diversity. We will run 5 artist-led community workshops to allow communities (SENS, primary schools and locals) to contribute to the Haunted House, including drawing, collage, performance, sound, storytelling and ghost tours.</q>

                <p>Autumn is a strange beast. It hovers in the air, pulling rusty leaves off trees, in restless anticipation of winter. In the ancient days, when humans were a lot more reliant on the capricious disposition of Mother Nature, autumn was the time of harvest and preparation for winter. Winter signified an end – end of harvest, end of year, and end of life. Crops died, rivers froze and people waited for the inhospitable landscape to warm up again. Physical preparedness was as important as spiritual, and many cultures had their own ways of welcoming winter. One such tradition that survives today is the modern incarnation of the ancient Gaelic festival, Samhain, known today as Halloween. Ancient Celts believed that on the 1st of November, the border between realms faded, allowing fairies and spirits to enter the world of the living. Offerings were left for them; food and drink, to propriate them, to guarantee that people and their livestock survived the winter. The Celtic day began and ended at sunset, so the festivities began on the night of the 31st of October, sacred bonfires were lit and huge feasts took place. This atmosphere of connectivity – not only with one's community but also with the world of spirits and souls of deceased family members – is relived each year on Halloween, when communities gather to socialise, share meals and offer sweets to children. Evoking this ancient meaning of coming together, we invited 70 emerging and established artists to display their work and share it with the local South London community.</p>
