        <h1>Mrs. Grieve</h1>
        <h2>An excerpt from a story about an undead woman, trapped inside a museum display cabinet. The character is loosely inspired by the human skeleton displayed in the London Operating Theatre Museum, and the story is an ode to Robin, a character in "Nightwood" by Djuna Barnes.</h2>

    <h3 class="firstSentence">Over a century passed before an idea of escape first popped into Mrs Grieve’s calm
    skull.</h3><p> Initially, it was a tiny seed, a subtle wrinkle on her forehead. It itched inside
    her eye socket, irritating and impossible to forget, like a tomato peel stuck to the
    back of the throat. She tried to push it down with crumbs of other thoughts –
    calming thoughts, serene thoughts, thoughts that would make her fall back asleep.
    But the seed has taken the root, unfurling deeper inside her, expanding in her
    cranium. It curled viciously, forming into a pulsing, nagging need for freedom; the
    need she’s managed to repress for so many years. All those years of old, serious
    men poking the arid, milky landscape of her ribs, taking notes about human
    anatomy–like she was a model, a perfect framework of a human being. Her! –with
    her deformed ribcage and missing hand bones. They even stamped her inner pelvic
    bone to mark where and who she belonged to.
    She was an odd thing–not quite human but ironically representing all that is
    human; the lively, the rich, the rotten, the desirable, the imperfect.</p>

    <p>All the lectures she participated in talked about how the biological purpose of the
    female body is to create life, to be a vessel for a new human being. To be the
    beginning. But– she thought– it was something else: the purpose of the female
    body was to die, to decompose. Is her loss of purpose due to already being dead;
    similar to infertility?
    At night she was tormented by dreams of babies born of her bones, with eyes
    exactly like hers; she never accepted the clinical perception of womanhood lightly.</p>

    <p>Types of cages: <br>
    glass box-shaped display case <br>
    physical body <br>
    own mind, the maker of oppressive thoughts <br>
    woman-shaped-cage <br>
    metal bar cage for tropical birds<br>
    ribcage
    <br>
    </p>

    <p>Straying–or rather her intense fantasies of straying, walking away, escaping–like
    Robin, walking into the night, taking a random train out of the city, anywhere but
    away from here. Same for her, fantasies of escape flooded her being. The walls of
    her glass cage closed tighter around her and, even though she had no organs left,
    her phantom stomach clenched in a retching, revolting contraction. The physical
    wall was easy–thin, fragile, made of the kind of glass that shatters if you gently tap
    the right spot–it was the wall inside her mind that was impenetrable. She scaled
    that wall every day, reading its surface with her fingers, searching for a crack or a
    minor hiccup in her oppressive thinking. Some nights she wandered the length of
    the wall, finding nothing but a tiny snow globe at her feet. It contained a miniature
    of herself, holding an even smaller snow globe in her hands, an infinite Russian
    doll, a perfected concept of incarceration. Was it punishment? A version of hell? Or
    was she just stuck in a loop of self-deprecation? She didn’t know. All she knew was
    that she had done it to herself.</p>

    <p>There was once a time in her life when she thought with death came freedom. She
    thought once all the discomforts of being a body ceased and she
    was–finally–deceased, she would be free. But what freedom meant was unclear.
    Perhaps her own body felt like a cage, with its regular need for sustenance and
    excretion, its constant motion, inhaling and exhaling, growth and expulsion,
    expansion and compression; all with the awkwardness of an itchy little toe inside a
    laced-up slipper; the rheumatic pain of her finger bone, broken in early childhood;
    and the sickening, meticulous punctuality of her menstrual cycles, leaving two
    crimson clock hands trickling down the insides of her thighs. She strived for
    irregularity and imperfection, but in body terms, this meant malfunction, it meant
    illness. True: Sometimes one meets a woman who is beast turning human; but
    sometimes, if you’re really lucky, you might just meet a woman who is human
    turning beast.</p>

    <p>A depiction–an artwork. A woman trapped in a motionless image, her body
    sprawled across the canvas, like roadkill. Always the subject, never the author.
    The road she walks is always dark (it is Night), the path she takes swerves away
    from comfort. Desire pulls her forward, the same desire a deer feels on the side of
    the road that magnetizes its eyes on the bright headlights of a speeding car. It
    escapes the paralysis of its fear by jolting onto the road, just like a moth flying into
    its demise, wings turned to smoke, and so does the deer have marks of burnt
    headlights on its crushed body. She walks this road alone, naked: the perfect
    figure; the prostitute; the saint; the exhibit; the piece of history; the medical
    model; the undead; the immigrant; and, of course, the woman.</p>
