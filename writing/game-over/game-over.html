                <p>Game Over is a game-text/text-game about in-betweenness, death and immortality, grappling with the question: “Who writes history?”. It explores the idea of voice as a form of resistance, going against the grain of comfortable, well-known and conservative archetypes. By tracing the hierarchical authority of history and the often mute rigidness of the archive, I wondered about what the voice is and how it is immortalised. I weave the voice of my text with the voices of seemingly
                disparate characters, uncovering their stories and revealing ways in which they were granted the right to speak, or – contrarily – how they were silenced. Their voice is interrupted, half-muted, disembodied. It pierces decades and reverberates in the future, chiming like a crystal bell. The voice of reason, the voice of madness, the voice that was cut in half and stuffed into someone else’s throat. Sometimes the voice jars loudly but is meaningless. Sometimes, thanks to its muteness, it is revolutionary. The voice travels and ends up in multiple endings, foretelling multiple beginnings. It is immortal. My research into immortality, resistance and death led me to two main areas (that later unfolded and expanded further, in the manner of white veins running through a lacey sheet of caul fat): the past (in which I focused on the proto-vampiric creature, the walking dead of the Eastern European folklore, known as upiór) and the future (imagined through sci-fi, specifically the genre of cyberpunk and video games as my focal point). I read both the past and the future from the sleek surface of the screen; their essence diminished into a compressed .pdf format, their potentiality
                unrealised, ethereal. I excavated slivers of this research from collapsed, digital remains. I took virtual walks through the crumbling, mossy London cemeteries. The past and the future, tied into a tight knot of the present.</p>

                 <p>Upiór. The word, charged with fear, glistens in the darkness, slithering uncomfortably near my chest. I back away,
                anxiously, away from the corner in which the word materialized, away from the table I was kneeling under, away from the
                dead man in the center.
                I stand upright in the cold chamber again, only now it has changed. People have left, extinguishing moribund candle
                flames with their warm fingers and easing the fluttering air into stillness. Dawn hasn't arrived yet, and the room is
                bathed in thick, syrupy greyness—deserted. I look over at the cadaver in the middle of the chamber. He looks back at me
                with his beady, black eyes. A single, slender tentacle of fear knots my throat closed. <br> <br>
                
                “Upiór”, I whisper.<br> <br>
                
                “Upiór”, he repeats.<br> <br>
                
                I trace down this paralysing feeling of fear, which expands in sweeping waves from my mind, down my throat, knotting my
                stomach closed. It is contradicted by a strange sense of familiarity and understanding; upiór’s face flickers and
                changes. He’s now my friend, my brother, my lover. Upiór, a well-known member of the community, who does chores and
                helps people in their everyday lives, is closer to a human than to a monster. His existence is never an uncertainty;
                he’s not mysterious, nor unexplainable, he just is. The absolute acceptance of his place among the people evokes a
                similarity between him and the medieval notion of death itself: he coexists, he never surprises and he occupies a place
                in daily life.</p>

                A vision of Polidori’s future glues to the topmost layer of my eye, like a worn-out contact lens. It goes like this:<br>
                The first release of Polidori’s short story the Vampyre is published against his will and accredited to Lord Byron. Its
                immediate success, partly thanks to the byronesque fame, comes as an insult to the doctor, who dreamed of literary
                success, and he slowly succumbs to depression and debt.
                On the 24th of August 1821 a miniscule vial filled with pale, blue liquid finds its way to John William Polidori’s lips.
                Things are in motion: his forearm, travelling to his mouth. The liquid, seeping into the entrance of his body. His
                tongue, pushing the premeditated sip deeper down. <br>
                The minute hand of the clock twitches; barely. <br>
                A thin layer coates his tongue tasting like <br>
                Metallic buttery bitter almonds <br>
                It enters his bloodstream <br>
                Lovingly and <br>
                Tighter <br>
                And tighter <br>
                Asphyxiation <br>
                And he falls, compliant <br> 
                And kisses the bottle goodbye. <br> <br> 
                
                The deafening act of his suicide is muffled into silence by the verdict of the coroner: a “natural death”. It comes
                under the influence of his family, who in order to preserve their reputation, twist the truth to their advantage. He is
                buried in the cemetery near the St. Pancras Old Church in London. Polidori’s sister, Charlotte, is in charge of the
                publication of his personal journals. She removes large parts of his writing with an excuse that these passages are too
                “piccant” to be revealed, and destroys the original manuscripts, sending his words into oblivion. 
                </p>


            </div>
            <div class="col">
                <p>In 1865 Polidori’s dead body, together with hundreds of other bodies buried in the St Pancras cemetery, unexpectedly
                turn into an annoying inconvenience. Their remains block the way for a brand new trainline, planned to connect commuting
                workers with the city center. The contracted architecture company quickly makes a decision and unloads the
                responsibility of exhuming and moving the bodies onto their young employee, Thomas Hardy. The only reminders that those
                bodies were once people are etched into stone; tombstones with their names are what’s left after the excavation, and
                Hardy, as if reacting to a nudging, melancholic compulsion, and unable to discard them, arranges them in a tight,
                compacted circle at the root of an ash tree, growing at the St. Pancras cemetery. Years later after he abandons London
                and his profession as an architect, devoting himself to writing poetry and novels, he writes a poem in honour of this
                experience:<br><br>
                
                "(...) We late-lamented, resting here, <br>
                Are mixed to human jam, <br>
                And each to each exclaims in fear, <br>
                'I know not which I am!' (...)” <br> <br>
                
                Polidori’s name, pressed against hundreds of other names, entangled in the roots of the living ash tree, erodes with the
                surface of his tombstone. The emergent memorial condenses the multiplicity of those diverse, individual lives into just
                one, single name: it is now known as the Hardy Tree.</p>

                    As these words fall hollowly between us, I glance at upiór, who’s now ready; he is unrecognizable. His messy hair is now
                    replaced with sleek, brushed back and lustrous blackness; clothes, perfectly fitted, advance his social class; his face,
                    even though the same, seems changed: chiselled, mysterious and alluring.<br>
                    Lord Ruthven smiles with a corner of his mouth and bows gently. The performance is over, and, dazzled by this
                    transformation, I applaud generously.<br>
                    Byron bursts out laughing from another side of the room.<br>
                    Has he been there this whole time? I seem to have missed his grand entrance, consumed by my own visions and thoughts. <br>
                    
                    Upiór reimagined by Polidori is now a well-taken care of gentleman, with sharpened up features; he is a U honed into V.
                    From now on, he is Lord Ruthven, Dracula, Nosferatu. He is the Vampyre.
                    He is also acutely reminiscent of Byron himself, who, still laughing, embraces his caricature affectionately and sneers:<br>
                    “Oh, Pollydolly, Pollydolly”.<br>
                    The newly found veil of mysticity obscures upiór’s familiarity. By turning into Lord Ruthven he becomes an outsider, an
                    enigmatic newcomer, and loses his position in the community; he’s no longer an obnoxious neighbour, who walks after
                    death, stealing milk; nor he’s an unlucky cousin, born in a caul; nor he is a lover, whose passion stops him from
                    staying in his grave. Vampyre’s arrival is shrouded in mystery, as if he appeared out of thin air, and he vanishes in
                    the same manner. He walks as a shadow, stripped of his humanity, his essence closer to a monster than that of a human.
